Portland, Oregon, Startups
=================

Ah Portland. So good at anecdotal evidence and qualifying stuff. Not always so good at quantifying stuff. 

So, in an effort to get more meaningful metrics on what's happening around these parts, I thought it might be valuable to do a better job of documenting what's happening in the the Portland startup community.

Best of all? You can help. Please join us in documenting the Portland startup community:
